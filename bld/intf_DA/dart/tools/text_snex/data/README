This directory contains a very simple text input file
to use as an example of reading in text data.  The observations
are one per line, and the items on each line are space separated; 
fixed width columns work well, too.

In this simple example, the first item on each line is an observation 
type code (1=snow depth, 2=snow water equivalent). 

The next two are latitude/longitude locations.

The next is the vertical elevation.  For snow depthe it is
in meters.

Then the time of the observation - year, month, day, hour, minute,
second.  

The last values are the actual observation values and an error
estimate.
